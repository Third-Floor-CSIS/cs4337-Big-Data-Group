### Reports
I was the main person in charge of organising the weekly reports.  
This covers everything from the format to nudging folks to fill out their sections as well as submissions.

### Microservice
The microservice I am in charge of is the Profile microservice.  
Overall it is a simple and self-contained service comprising of CRU (no delete in this prototype).

### Reviews
A solid chunk of my contributions were on the PR's, giving feedback and requesting changes.  
This feedback often contained reasons why changes were required.

### Discord Webhooks
I setup the discord webhook so any changes on the repo would be immediately sent to a channel on our group Discord.  
This dramatically increased interactions on all github related events since all members were pinged by it.
